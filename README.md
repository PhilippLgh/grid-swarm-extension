# Grid Swarm Plugin

This is the example Swarm integration for Grid based on the tutorial:
[Building a P2P file sharing app with Swarm and Grid](https://github.com/PhilippLgh/ethereum-grid-tutorials/blob/master/Swarm.md)

If you want to use this plugin in Grid you can add it to `plugins.json` like this:

```

  "name": "swarm",
  "displayName": "Swarm",
  "type": "storage",
  "author": {
